# Dotfiles

After some Insperation in YT I created my own dotfiles which I can deploy on Linux and MacOS.


It's basicly for my own use. 
Attention: The install.sh script removes without asking config files and folders and replaces them with symlinks.
Removed are .vimrc, .vim, .tmux.conf, .zshrc and ~/bin (List may incomplete, check script)
